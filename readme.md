 Introduced a functioning flask app and psycopg2-functions to be used with the temperature.html file.
Takes in a location name e.g. 'GÃ¶teborg' and produces a graph pulled from a database of stored temperature data. 

Future functions are likely to include other metereological observations and more javascript integration such as asking for current location,
in addition to additional front-end features.
